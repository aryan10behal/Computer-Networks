Even though the link between B and C is broken, still we can find that the cost of reaching A to C and B to C keeps on increasing even though we cant reach C from A or B. This is because in routing table of A, after converging, we will have entry that we can reach C via B. This table when shared with B causes B to reach C via A. When new updated routing table of B is shared with A, A again updates its table and the process goes on.. This results in cost of reaching C from A and B increase with more iterations. This problem is famously known as "count to infinity". This should have been avoided at the first place by stopping B to update its routing table from A for a route that goes via B itself. The costs will keep on increaing and tables will never converge. We break out of the loop when hop count becomes 16 which define unreachbale connection or infinite distance.
